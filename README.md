A weather app built using React allows users to view real-time weather data for any location. It features a clean, responsive UI, enabling users to search for a city and display current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy). The app integrates with an external API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live weather data and displays corresponding icons and backgrounds based on the weather. The app also handles errors for invalid city searches and can provide a forecast for upcoming days.

1.Setting Up Your React Project
You can create a new React application using Create React App, which sets up everything you need for a React project.

npx create-react-app weather-app
cd weather-app

2.Install dependencies
If you're using npm:

npm install

3.Start the development server
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development serve

npm start

4.React Folder Structure
By default, the structure of a React app will look like this:

weather-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── (other files)
├── package.json
└── (other config files)

5.Creating Components
React apps are made of components, which are reusable pieces of UI. Components can be written as either classes or functions.

exapmle:
app.jsx

import Weatherapp from './Weatherapp';
import './Infobox.css'
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
 return(
  <>
  <Weatherapp /> //it is an component which contain further component
  </>
 );
}

export default App;

6.State and Props
State: Allows components to manage their own data that can change over time.
Props: Short for "properties", these are used to pass data from parent components to child components.

import { useState } from 'react';
export default function Searchbox({updateInfo}){
    let [City, setCity] = useState("");
    return(
    <div className="Searchbox">
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <TextField id="City" label="City Name" variant="outlined" required value={City} onChange={handleChange}/>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <Button variant="contained" type='Submit'>Search
      </Button>
      )
}

7.Event Handling
React handles events like clicks, form submissions, etc., through props. Event handlers are passed to elements as props (like onClick, onSubmit, etc.).
export default function Searchbox({updateInfo}){
    let [City, setCity] = useState("");
     let handleSubmit = async (evt) =>{
        alert('form submited'); // its for an example full structured code is provided
    };
     return(
    <div className="Searchbox">
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <TextField id="City" label="City Name" variant="outlined" required value={City} onChange={handleChange}/>
        <Button variant="contained" type='Submit'>Search
      </Button>
      )
  }
8.Styling
You can style your React components in various ways:

Inline styles (using style attribute).
CSS classes (import a .css file).
Styled-components (for more advanced and scoped CSS).

9.Using API 
using aplication programming interface for getting weather information(data) of various city's 

10.Deployment
using netlify to deploy project
